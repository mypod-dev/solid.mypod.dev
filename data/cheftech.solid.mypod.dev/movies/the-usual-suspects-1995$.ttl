        "Held in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor \u2013 leaving few survivors. Verbal lures his interrogators with an incredible story of the crime lord's almost supernatural prowess.";
